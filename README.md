## UX Design

### Strategy Plane

- Site Goal

- Target Audience

- Is there a need for this?

- Is the content relevant?

- Customer Needs:

As the viability score matches the importance score, I should in theory be able to implement all of the above features. This may well change as I begin the work, due to distractions and unforseen difficulties. The scores above have been based on my own skill levels currently. I may have estimated incorrectly for some, therefore changing the time needed. Between sprints I will reassess each opportunity to see what is more feasable.

### Scope Plane

In order to manage the workload for each sprint, I have divided the above opportunities into three categories, depending on their overall importance to reaching a minimum viable product (MVP).

- Must Have

- Should Have

- Could Have

### Structure Plane

#### User Stories

### Skeleton Plane

#### Site Flow

#### Wireframes

### Surface Plane

#### Colour Scheme

#### Typography

## Honourable Mentions

- Spencer Barriball - My mentor throughout the project. Always able to answer any questions I have and is such a positive person to have around.
